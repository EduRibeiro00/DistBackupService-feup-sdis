**Project 1: Serverless Distributed Backup Service** 

* Distributed peer-to-peer system (locally), developed in Java, that allows the backup of a file divided in chunks in other peers; also allows the restoration and deletion of a file, and the reclaim of a peer's personal space;
* Usage of a well defined message protocol to communicate between peers;
* Usage of thread-pools and non-blocking I/O to achieve high concurrency and parallelism.
* Languages/technologies used: **Java, Shell**.

**Grade**: 19.6 / 20

**Project 2: Distributed Backup System in the Internet**

* Distributed peer-to-peer system in the Internet, developed in Java, that allows the backup of a file divided in chunks in other peers; also allows the restoration and deletion of a file, and the reclaim of a peer's personal space;
* Various features of the system were taken into account, like its scalability and fault-tolerance (usage of the Chord protocol), and using secure communication channels (JSSE);
* Usage of thread-pools and non-blocking I/O to achieve high concurrency and parallelism.
* Languages/technologies used: **Java, Shell**.

**Grade**: 18.01 / 20
